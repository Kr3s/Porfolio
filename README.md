**My Web Design Portfolio.**<br/>
This is where I'm going to be posting my current and previous work. But for now, I'm going to work on getting it all set up so I can have somewhere to showcase my work.

## To-do List:
  1. Design layout of pages.
  2. Write up a rough draft of the homepage.
  3. Aquire a unique domain for the website.
  4. Add security to the back end of the site.
  5. Etc..

-This is a constant **W.I.P** and will be updated almost daily.
